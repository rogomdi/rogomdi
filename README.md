# Hello! üëã I'm Roberto G√≥mez

I'm a passionate software engineer with over 5 years of experience, specializing in backend development and DevOps.

## Backend Development

I started in 2015 developing internal applications for a financial department. A few years later, I became interested in microservices.

### üßπ Clean Code
**Clean Code**: My first rule is to always follow best practices. Of course, sometimes, to deliver features on time, technical debt may occur, but I believe this shouldn't be the norm.

### <img src="java.png" style="width:18px"> <img src="spring-icon.svg" style="width:18px"> Java & Spring Boot
Since then, I've mostly worked with Java and Spring Boot, building microservices using various communication methods like REST APIs and GraphQL, and implementing messaging with RabbitMQ or Kafka.

### üêç Python
In addition to Java, I've also developed microservices using Python.

## DevOps

Working in startups has given me hands-on experience with the entire software development lifecycle, including managing services on AWS and Azure, and setting up CI/CD systems with Jenkins, CircleCI, and Azure DevOps.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS
While I'm not a dedicated DevOps engineer, I've been an AWS account administrator, handling IAM permissions, creating infrastructure with CloudFormation, exposing UIs through CloudFront, and setting up Lambda functions for various tasks.

### <img src="azure.png" style="width:24px"> Azure
I've also utilized Microsoft Azure services in some companies I've worked for, including Azure Blob Storage, VMs, AKS, API Management, and Key Vault.

### üîÑ CI/CD
I've configured CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Azure DevOps, and CircleCI. For personal projects, I prefer GitHub Actions.

### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am Roberto GÃ³mez

---

I am a passionate software engineer mostly focused on backend and devops with more than 5 years of experience.

I started in 2015 developing internal applications for a financial department, but, a few years later, I became interested in microservices.

From that time on, I've working mostly using Java and microservices with Spring boot, but that's not all, I've also developed microservices using Python as main language.

As most of my experience has been in startups, I've been involved in all the software development cycle, so I have experience working and managing services on AWS and Azure as long as CI systems such as Jenkins, Circle CI or Azure Devops.

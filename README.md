I am a passionate software engineer mostly focused on backend and devops with more than 5 years of experience.

Development
---
I started in 2015 developing internal applications for a financial department, but, a few years later, I became interested in microservices <img src="microservices.svg" style="width:24px">.

- <img src="clean-code.png" style="width:24px"> **Clean Code** : My first rule is to follow the best practices always. Of course, at some point, in order to deliver some features on time, you can ignore some things generating technical debt on your project, but I think that can't be the usual behavior of coding.

- <img src="java.png" style="width:24px"> + <img src="spring-icon.svg" style="width:24px">: From that time on, I've been working mostly using Java and microservices with Spring Boot. I've built those services using different communication methods, REST APIs, GraphQL, as well as listening and producing events/messages with RabbitMQ or Kafka.

- <img src="python.png" style="width:24px">: That's not all, I've also developed microservices using Python as main language.

DevOps
---

As most of my experience has been in startups, I've been involved in all the software development cycle, so I have experience working and managing services on AWS and Azure as long as CI systems such as Jenkins, Circle CI or Azure Devops.

- <img src="aws.png" style="width:24px">: Even thought I am not a pure DevOps, for a period of time I've been an AWS account administrator, so it means that I was managing permissions on IAM, creating infrastructure like VMs or different Kubernetes clusters (EKS), setting up automated infrastructure using CloudFormation, exposing UIs to the internet using CloudFront, creating Lambdas to trigger some tasks, etc.

- <img src="azure.png" style="width:24px">: I've been using some of the services provided by Microsoft Azure in the applications I've been working on for the infrastructure, some of them are Azure Blob Storage, Azure VMs, AKS, API Management, Key Vault...

- <img src="ci-cd.png" style="width:32px">: For the CI/CD I've setup pipelines in tools such as Jenkins, Azure Devops or CircleCI. Also, on my personal projects I use to setup pipelines using Github Actions.
